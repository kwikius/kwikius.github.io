	<h2>Weight</h2>
	<p>
	  The boat should be light for speed .. however if the boat is too light she reacts so fast to gusts etc 
	  that she is difficult to control, without lightning reactions.<br>
	  On the other hand a heavy boat needs a lot of buoyancy in the floats.
	  Most succesful Mini40s seem to weigh about 5lbs.
	</p>
	<h2>Stiffness</h2>
	<p>
	  With a conventional main/headsail arrangement it is important to keep tension in the forestay.<br>
	  This is much more difficult in a multihull than a monohull,
	  and is the main reason why carbon is often used for the crossbeams etc.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Here are some diagrams on hull stresses.<br>
	  Both forces are acting - but can be separated for ease of understanding.
