	<p class = Question>
	Where can I get multihull boat plans
	</p>

	<p class = question>
	  You describe Kwiki as a Catamaran but she looks
	  like a Trimaran. Is she a Cat or a Tri?
	</p>
	<p>
	  The boat is actually a Catamaran.<br>
	  What looks like a main Hull is actually a "Pod" which is designed to
	  be just clear of the water.
	</p>
	<hr>
	<p class = question>
	  Whats the point of the Pod?
	</p>
	<p>
	  +1 Its easier to keep the radio in. Otherwise Cats need
	  to use 1 or both hulls.<br>
	  +2 Cats with two T foil rudders(on Hulls) tend to stay glued to thewater.:-(
	  1 central rudder is more fun( Flying a hull):-) So you can hang a rudder from it.<br>
	  +3 It provides tension in the forestay much better than rigging off
	  the two hulls (stretchy yeeurch)<br>
	  +4 The Aerodynamics are better up wind if you can close the gap at the foot<br>
	  of the sail( but strangely better offwind if you dont! - normal "open plan"
	  cats are generally better than tris offwind ). You need to get into
	  aerodynamics for this but (hopefully) the effect of the Pod is to increase
	  the effective aspect ratio of the sail- why Marbleheads etc have such
	  tall sails. Forward 30% does most hence "down by bow"/Extra wetted surfaceTrade off.<br>
	  +5 The pod is designed to be good in torsion-Now Cat Main hulls dont need to do this job can be lighter.<br>
	  -1 it adds weight compared to nothing(but see +5 above)<br>
	  -2 its more construction:-( ( but see +1)
	</p>
	<hr>
	<p class = question>
	  Which are better Catamarans or Trimarans?
	</p>
	<p>
	  Trimarans are better for "round the cans " racing.<br>
	  They seem to turn better especially in light winds, and because the
	  boat leans on one float or other, it helps the sail to set.<br>
	  I reckon Catamarans are faster in the right conditions ie reaching in a good wind.<br>
	  (As time goes on I am optimising "Kwiki" for pure straight line speed)<br>
	  Generally I reckon you will have more fun with a Trimaran.<br>
	  I went down the Catamaran route in the Early days of Model Cats & Tris in England.
	  I started building Kwiki before I figured out that Trimarans were probably better for racing.<br>
	  I always meant to build a Tri, but I began to think they looked a bit
	  ugly waggling their windward float in the air, Kwiki looks mean and sails flat.<br>
	  Also where I live there are some big waters with constant winds.<br>
	  Kwiki is a bit specialised. If the weathers light I probably wont go sailing.
	  Also I dont race much.
	</p>
	<hr>
	<p class = question>
	  Does the construction need to be so complicated?
	</p>
	<p>
	  No. You could use aluminium/carbon tube for the beams and purchase some moulded hulls.<br>
	  That way you will save yourself a lot of time.<br>
	  When I built Kwiki I decided I wouldnt make compromises.<br>
	  She was a lot of work to build, but its not the only way.
	</p>
	<hr>
	<p class =question>
	  Whats the T- foil?
	</p>
	<p>
	  The T-foil is a small wing attached to the bottom of the rudder.<br>
	  Its angled slightly downwards and prevents the boat from flipping when running.<br>
	  Its not absolutely essential- some skippers dont use it, but it makes the boat easier to sail.<br>
	  It has one annoying characteristic, that it makes the boat bear off as it heels.<br>
	  Its an interesting experiment to sail with it and without it to see the difference it makes.
	<hr>
	<p class = question>
	  Is Kwiki part of a class like Mini40 or Formula48?
	</p>
	<p>
	  No. She was designed to fit the 1.2M rule which was the first Multihull class in England.<br>
	  Then there were only two rules: max 4ft long , max 4ft wide. We didnt really even need to write that down!<br>
	  At some stage The IYRU got involved and the fun seemed to go out of it.<br>
	  A rule regarding bow bumpers was introduced, and I didnt have the heart to cut up<br>
	  WhiteLight(my old boat) or Kwikis Hulls to fit them, so I dropped out of racing.<br>
	  I still have a lot of plans for Kwiki and can implement them,
	  without worrying that they may infringe some current or future rule.
